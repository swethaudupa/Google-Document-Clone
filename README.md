# Google Document Clone

## About the project

It's a Google doc clone app which is built using ReactJS and create-react-app for the starter kit. It uses a wrapper called [tinymce-react](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-react) which in turn uses tinyMCE editor to make use of the functionalities used in the Google document.
The app is built using react hooks which was released in React 16.8. Items in toolbar and menu are arranged in the same order as Google Doc. All the buttons in the app are functional except Share to maintain simplicity. **Add a comment** button has not been added as it is a premium feature. 
The content of the document can be saved on click of the save button in the toolbar. It gets saved in local storage based on the following conditions:
-  If the document is being saved for the first time
-  If the document name is not the same as the previously saved document, then add the document to the existing array of documents 

Console.log if the document name is same as the documents previously saved documents.
You can open the documents saved by going into the **File** menu and hovering **open recent** menu item. Clicking on the recent document will show its content.

## Getting Started

### `Yarn`
Download all the dependencies

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
